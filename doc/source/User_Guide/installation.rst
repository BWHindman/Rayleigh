Compiling and Installing Rayleigh
=================================

A detailed explanation of the installation process may be found in the
root directory of the code repository at:

  Rayleigh/INSTALL.

We provide an abbreviated version of those instructions here.

Third-Party Dependencies
------------------------

In order to compile Rayleigh, you will need to have MPI (Message Passing
Interface) installed along with a Fortran 2003-compliant compiler.
Rayleigh has been successfully compiled with GNU, Intel, and IBM
compilers (PGI has not been tested yet). Rayleigh’s configure script
provides native support for the Intel and GNU compilers. See
Rayleigh/INSTALL for an example of configuration using the IBM compiler.

Rayleigh depends on the following third party libraries:

#. BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)

#. LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage)

#. FFTW 3.x (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)

You will need to install these libraries before compiling Rayleigh. If
you plan to run Rayleigh on Intel processors, we suggest installing
Intel’s Math Kernel Library (MKL) in lieu of installing these libraries
individually. The Math Kernel Library provides optimized versions of
BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW. It has been tuned, by Intel, for optimal
performance on Intel processors. At the time of this writing, MKL is
provided free of charge. You may find it
`here <https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl>`__.

Compilation
-----------

Rayleigh is compiled using the standard Linux installation scheme of
configure/make/make-install. From within the Rayleigh directory, run
these commands:

#. **./configure** – See Rayleigh/INSTALL or run ./configure --help to
   see relevant options.

#. **make** – This produces the code. You can run **make -j** to build several
   files in parallel and speed up the build this way.

#. **make install** – This places the Rayleigh executables in
   Rayleigh/bin. If you would like to place them in (say)
   /home/my_rayleigh, run configure as: **./configure
   –prefix=/home/my_rayleigh**.

For most builds, two executables will be created: rayleigh.opt and
rayleigh.dbg. Use them as follows:

#. When running production jobs, use **rayleigh.opt**.

#. If you encounter an unexpected crash and would like to report the
   error, rerun the job with **rayleigh.dbg**. This version of the code
   is compiled with debugging symbols. It will (usually) produce
   meaningful error messages in place of the gibberish that is output
   when rayleigh.opt crashes.

If *configure* detects the Intel compiler, you will be presented with a
number of choices for the vectorization option. If you select *all*,
rayleigh.opt will not be created. Instead, rayleigh.sse, rayleigh.avx,
etc. will be placed in Rayleigh/bin. This is useful if running on a
machine with heterogeneous node architectures (e.g., Pleiades). If you
are not running on such a machine, pick the appropriate vectorization
level, and rayleigh.opt will be compiled using that vectorization level.

Verifying Your Installation
---------------------------

Rayleigh comes with a benchmarking mode that helps you verify that the
installation is performing correctly. If you are running Rayleigh for
the first time, or running on a new machine, follow along with the
example in §\ `[sec:benchmarking] <#sec:benchmarking>`__, and verify
that you receive an accurate benchmark report before running a custom
model.
