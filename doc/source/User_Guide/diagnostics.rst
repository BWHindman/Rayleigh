Diagnostic Outputs
==================

Rayleigh comes bundled with an in-situ diagnostics package that allows
the user to sample a simulation in a variety of ways, and at
user-specified intervals throughout a run. This package is comprised of
roughly 17,000 lines of code (about half of the Rayleigh code base), and
it is complex enough that we describe it in two other documents. We
refer the user to :

#. The diagnostics plotting manual, provided in three formats:

   -  Rayleigh/etc/analysis/Diagnostics_Plotting.ipynb (Jupyter Python
      notebook format; recommended for interactive use)

   -  Rayleigh/doc/Diagnostics_Plotting.html (recommended for optimal
      viewing; generated from the .ipynb file)

   -  Rayleigh/doc/Diagnostics_Plotting.pdf (same content as .html and
      .ipynb, but formatting quality is inferior)

#. Rayleigh/doc/rayleigh_output_variables.pdf â€“ This companion document
   provides the output menu system referred to in the main diagnostics
   documentation.

A number of stand-alone Python plotting examples may also be found in
the Rayleigh/etc/analysis directory.
