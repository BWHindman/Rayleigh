Troubleshooting
===============

If you have questions that go beyond this manual, there are a number of
resources:

-   For questions on the source code of Rayleigh,
    portability, installation, new or existing features, etc., use the
    Rayleigh forum at
    <https://community.geodynamics.org/c/rayleigh>.

-   In case of more general questions about mantle convection, you can ask on
    the CIG mantle convection forum at
    <https://community.geodynamics.org/c/dynamo>.

-   If you have specific questions about Rayleigh
    that are not suitable for public and archived forums, you can contact the
    primary developers as listed at <https://github.com/geodynamics/Rayleigh/#more-information>.
