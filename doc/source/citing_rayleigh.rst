Citing Rayleigh
===============

We ask that you cite the appropriate references if you publish results that were obtained in some
part using Rayleigh.  Receiving citations for Rayleigh is important to demonstrate the relevance of our work to our funding agencies and is a matter of fairness to all the developers that have donated their effort and time to make Rayleigh what it is today.

Please cite the code as:
  Featherstone, Nicholas A., Edelmann, Philipp V. F., Gassmoeller, Rene, Matilsky, Loren I., & Wilson, Cian R. (2024). Rayleigh Version 1.2.0 (v1.2.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6522806

National Science Foundation through the Dynamo Working Group of the
Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG,
https://geodynamics.org/groups/dynamo).

Please acknowledge CIG support in your work as follows:

  .. note::

    Rayleigh is hosted and receives support from the Computational
    Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) which is supported by the
    National Science Foundation awards NSF-0949446, NSF-1550901 and NSF-2149126.

Publishing
----------

Open research statements are now a common requirement when publishing research. 
These support reuse, validation, and citation and often take the form of *Data availability, Data access, 
Code availability, Open Research*, and *Software availability* statements.
We recommend depositing input files that allow your published research to be reproduced and 
output model data in support of your research outcomes and figures. 
In addition, consider depositing model files that may be reused by others.

Remember to cite software and data in your text as well as in your Data Availability or similar statement.

Files should be deposited in an approved repository.

Additional information on `Publishing <https://geodynamics.org/software/software-bp/software-publishing` is available on the CIG website.

**Input parameters**

* Main_input, *_input 
* Data files for custom: 
  * profiles, 
  * boundary conditions, 
  * generic initial conditions, 
  * reference states (coefficients)

Repository
~~~~~~~~~~

The Rayleigh Simulation Library (RSL), a repository for accessing published Rayleigh datasets has been 
established using the Open Science Framework (OSF) at the University of Colorado Boulder.
