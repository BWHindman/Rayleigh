Accessing and Sharing Model Data
***********************************

Accessing Available Datasets
----------------------------

Rayleigh model configurations and checkpoint data of several publications can be accessed here:

A large number of Rayleigh simulations were generated as part of the INCITE project
"Frontiers in Planetary and Stellar Magnetism Through High Performance Computing"
supported by the Department of Energy and the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics.
Results and publications of this project can be found here:
