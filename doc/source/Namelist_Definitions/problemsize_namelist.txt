**n_r** 
  Number of radial points in model grid
**rmin**
  Radius of the inner domain boundary, :math:`r_\mathrm{min}`
**rmax**
  Radius of the outer domain boundary, :math:`r_\mathrm{max}`       
**aspect_ratio**
  :math:`{r_\mathrm{min}}/{r_\mathrm{max}}`  
**shell_depth** 
  :math:`r_\mathrm{max}-r_\mathrm{min}`
**n_theta**
  Number of theta points in the model grid, :math:`N_\theta`
**l_max**
  Truncation degree :math:`\ell_\mathrm{max}` used in the spherical harmonic expansion
**n_l**
  :math:`\ell_\mathrm{max}+1`  
**nprow**
  Number of MPI ranks within each row of the 2-D process grid 
**npcol**
  Number of MPI ranks within each column of the 2-D process grid
**ncheby**
  Comma-separated list indicating number of Chebyshev polynomials used in each radial subdomain (e.g., 16, 32, 16). Default: n_r [ single domain]
**dealias_by**
  Comma-separated list indicating number of Chebyshev modes dealiased to zero.  Default is 2/3 ncheby.
**domain_bounds**
  The domain bounds defining each Chebyshev subdomain
**n_uniform_domains**
  Number of uniformly-sized Chebyshev domains spanning the depth of the shell.  Default: 1 
**uniform_bounds**
  When set to .true., each chebyshev subdomain will possess the same radial extent.  Default:  .false.
**dr_weights**
  Comma-separated list of of real-valued numbers that defines the relative weighting of gridpoint spacing between subregions of uniform grid spacing when working with finite-differences and a nonuniform mesh.  If left unspecified, a uniform grid spanning from rmin to rmax will be employed.  dr_weights should contain the same number of elements as nr_count. NEED A NOTE HERE TO SEE SECTION SUCH AND SUCH FOR DETAILS.
**nr_count**
  Comma-separated list of integer numbers that defines the number of radial points within each region of uniform grid spacing.  nr_count must contain the same number of elements as dr_weights.  When nr_count and dr_weights are specified, any value of n_r specified in main_input is ignored, and n_r is instead set to SUM(nr_count).  NEED A NOTE HERE TO SEE SECTION SUCH AND SUCH FOR DETAILS.
