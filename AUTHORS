Rayleigh was originally developed by Nicholas Featherstone.

Since then many more people have contributed and Rayleigh has grown into a
project with many authors. A complete and growing list can be found at:

Special thanks to Michael Calkins, Moritz Heimpel, Bradley Hindman, Wei Jiang,
and Ryan Orvedahl, Krista Soderlund, and Rakesh Yadav for their intensive beta
testing of the code.
