! This is a smaller and faster version of the
! input_examples/benchmark_diagnostics_input model. The output of the model is
! not yet in steady-state, but only used as a regression test. Whenever
! something changes the functionality of tthe code, it will hopefully affect
! the results of this benchmark.
