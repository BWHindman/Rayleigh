This is a docker container that can be used to run Rayleigh on the set of TACC
supercomputers, in particular Frontera and Stampede3, without having to manually
compile the code.

Steps to use this container on Stampede3/Frontera are described on
https://rayleigh-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/source/User_Guide/getting_started.html.
