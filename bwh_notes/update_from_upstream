To update changes made on Nick's repositories:

login on some machine
git remote -v				(Shows the <origin> of the cloned repository and which upstream respository that was originally forked)
git pull				(Pull down all changes from the upstream repository)
git checkout <branch>			(Move to the local branch to be updated)
git merge upstream/<branch>		(This merges the upsteam changes with the local changes for the common branch)
(git add .  -- may be needed)
(git commit -- may be needed)
git push				(Push all the changes back to the remote <origin>

do pulls on all other machines


Or if you want to update a single branch
git pull upstream <branch>		(Individual branches can be updated with git pull upstream <branch>)
git push origin <branch>
