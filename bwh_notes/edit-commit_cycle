Once happy with edits:

Change to ~/Rayleigh 		(root directory, NOT in Rayleigh/src for example)
git remote -v			(lists which repository this was cloned from <remote>, and which repository remote was forked from <upstream>)
git add . 			(compiles the list of changes, single files can be added using git add <file>)
git commit 			(brings up a text editor that allows comments about changes)
git push <remote> <branch>	(shoves the changes back to the repository listed as <remote> for the listed <branch>)
